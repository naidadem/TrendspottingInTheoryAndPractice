What things around your are out-of-date or unpractical in today´s context. Can you find the zombies of our time?

Zombie hunt is an exercise to find things, phenomena or events that are "living dead". This means that they remain in our time but in many ways have outlived its usefulness. A quick example might be DVD´s or CD´s, you can still buy them (they are alive), but for how long?

The task is to identify, describe and discuss zombies as a way of understanding trends and societal transformation. Try to find and make a list of a few examples that you might discover in your research phase. 

What to do?

After reading the articles, use the "zombie framework" and with the use of text, pictures and graphics, describe your zombie candidates. Also discuss and answer subjects like: What changes are driving this to be a zombie, and what are the forces countering this? (You are also free to come up with your own points of interest)

The format of the submission is a presentation . A presentation in this context means a self-explanatory combination of pictures and smaller sections of text. To be clear, and simply put, a power point presentation or similar.
