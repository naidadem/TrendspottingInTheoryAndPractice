This is an assignment aiming for self-reflection. A good learning process starts by having a good understanding of one’s current status.

So, in order to refine your knowledge of your trend watching status, you, as a student, need to understand how you and/or your organization act today. Make a summarized visualization of current behavior. How do you go about staying informed, inspired and ready for innovation? What kind of sources and situations do you rely on? Include all kind of sources, from newspapers and academic influences to family, friends and work activities to travels and conferences, radio programs, podcasts, web sites etc.A clever way to approach assignment is to start off by keeping a diary for a few days focusing on mapping your sources. Be as specific as possible in order to discuss your methods.

A tip is to avoid use very generalized source descriptions like "Internet news sights" or even worse only "Internet". Rather try to map what kind of news sight (or other) you follow, a bit more in-depth mapping will give a better understanding of own behaviors. To high light the example with news sights; a more in-depth can show you if you for example just follow national news, or news connected to a specific interest area (like, trade or specialist press).
