Article Study

Everything in this field, foresight and trendspotting, starts with a process of scanning for weak signals. Scanning is an ongoing activity and can be performed in a number of ways. For trendspotting this is the one thing everything starts with, and of course, research has been done in this area.This assignment let you dig a bit deeper in the research of the field.

What to do?

For this assignment you get a selection of six articles. In one way or another they present different aspects on scanning or identifying weak signals. Check them out and select a minimum of two articles. Read them and write a short report (1200-1500 words) by answering the following questions:

- Identify and discuss the key concepts in the texts.

- Describe and discuss some strong points.

- Describe and discuss some weak points you may have noticed, motivate!

- Any valuable (personal) lessons from this reading – list them and explain why?

You do not need to structure your report specifically to answer the questions by for example using them as headers. You can use a personal or more creative structure if you like. But it should be clear, transparent  and easy to find these "answers" in your text, regardless the structure. 


Make sure your assignment:

Cover presented issues above
treats at least two articles.
Reaches an minimum length of 1200, and most 1500 words.
Are a PDF or a Word compatible format.
References to other literature should be used if needed.
