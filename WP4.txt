WP4 Foresight, accurate and trustworty?

Lists of trends and ratings of trends are often presented in different media. To read them and to use them as a starting point for any discussion is often interesting and rewarding. At first, the content may not seem to be relevant for all businesses, but in many cases it is relevant. Often these lists are not problematized, and the complexity of occurring trends is not discussed. Attached is a report from the European Commission where different trends and topics are discussed. In this report however, there is a discussion about how different trends relate to each other as well as their individual progress.

Select at least one chapter or sequence from this foresight report, produced by the European Commission, to reflect and write about (approximately 650-1000 words).

Read it, consider the content and how it is presented and answer/discuss the following issues:

- How do you perceive the report in areas like relevance, trustworthiness – motivate! Use the study material.

- What is the most or least relevant among the trends presented – motivate!

- What is the presented trends based on? Methods for finding and describing trends?

- Is something missing? Selection of topics?

- Perspective? What can you say about that. 

Make sure your assignment:

There is of course some flexibility in how to approach presented subjects, but the assignment should answer or discuss the questions.

Recommended length of 650 to 1000 words.
